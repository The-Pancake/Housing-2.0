# Backend Information
This document contains the following:
- Algorithms used for assigning students their rooms
- Information strucuture of campus dorms and students
- Database structure on MongoDB
- Interaction through FastAPI

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are used in determining a student or a group of students' rooms that they will be assigned.<br>
- Singles Search
- Ideal/General Search
- Ideal/General Split Search
- Ideal/General Near Search
- Near Building Search

### Ideal vs General Algorithms
Ideal algorithms attempt to put students/groups into the dorm that falls into their preferred dorm list<br>
General algorithms attmpt to put students/groups into any dorm that fits them

### Singles Search
### Ideal/General Search
### Ideal/General Split Search

### Ideal/General Near Search
### Near Building Search
