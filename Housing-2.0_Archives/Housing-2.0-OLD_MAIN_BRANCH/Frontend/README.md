# Getting Started with the Frontend
In order to install and run our frontend, we will be using npm (node package manager) in order
to start up a development server. 

# Installing npm
To get started with npm, move into the frontend directory. This can be done with the following command 
from the Housing-2.0 root directory: 
cd .\frontend\ on Windows or cd ./frontend on all other systems

Then, to actually install npm run the command:
npm i

# Running the server
After npm finishes installing the required modules, run this command:
npm run start

This will start up the server and allow you to view the website on localhost:3000
