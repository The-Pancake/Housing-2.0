# Housing-2.0
Have you ever thought “RPI’s housing portal sucks”? That’s because it does. Housing 2.0 aims to revamp and recreate an improved version so that everyone has a more streamlined experience as well as less stress during the application process. The goal is to add many features that seem intuitive but are virtually non-existent in the current housing portal as well as new features that will aid in assigning students to their preferred housing such that the majority of students have their preferences met.
